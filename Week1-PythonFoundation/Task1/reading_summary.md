Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad concept of creating machines that can think and perform tasks like humans. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where machines learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning (DL) is a specialized part of ML that uses neural networks to process complex data like images and speech. Data Science is the field of analyzing and interpreting large amounts of data to extract insights, which can be used in AI and ML applications. In short, AI is the goal, ML and DL are techniques to achieve it, and Data Science provides the data and insights to make them effective.
